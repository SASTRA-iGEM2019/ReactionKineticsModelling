# Cell-free reaction kinetics modelling of second generation toehold switches 
Standard mass action kinetics to computationally evaluate the performance of toehold switches as biosensors of miRNA biomarkers. 

* Initial_CLSB_model.m :
Simulation inspired by the "initial model" described in [iGEM CLSB-UK](http://2017.igem.org/Team:CLSB-UK/Model#) (2017) 
* Final_CLSB_model.m :
Simulation extending the 'initial model' above and inspired by the "final model" described in [iGEM CLSB-UK](http://2017.igem.org/Team:CLSB-UK/Model#) (2017) 
* Complete_model_fluorescence.m :
Generalisation of kinetics to second generation toehold switches. Here, an upstream reaction between miRNA biomarker and  synthetic anti-miRNA with partial complementarity to the miRNA biomarker, and a downstream reaction accounting for the GFP maturation, were added to the 'final model' above.

Executable SBML of the above 'Complete model.'
