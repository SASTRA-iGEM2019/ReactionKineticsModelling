Project Title: Reaction Kinetics Modelling of Second generation Toehold switches for miRNA biomarkers 
Description: We employed mass action kinetics to computationally evaluate the performance of designed toehold switches as biosensors of miRNA biomarkers. 
Before understanding the reaction kinetics of the designed second generation toehold switches
